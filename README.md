# Binary Trees Based Text Parser
Binary Trees Text File Parser- Data Structures( Java )

You are to write a program that reads in a body of text and inserts the text into a binary tree class that you write from scratch based on alphabetical order. You should keep an instance count for each word in the text. Each time a duplicate word is added you should be able to update the instance count for that word. At the end of the text insertion you will show statistics for the run.
